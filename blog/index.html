           <p>Here I am writing about what i think my journey into tech is, bear with me as I navigate through the meandering trejectory that got me. Bear in mind too, that I am a story teller.
            </p>
            <p>I promise to do my utmost to keep it succint and short!</p> 
            <p> May I start by saying, to any dreamer out their, pleasee do not stop dreaming however, like others and i get up and do something no matter how little
                believe me it will build up to somethng sooner than you think, although it may not look so at times. 
            </p>
            <p>May a suggestion at this juncture that you getting yourself a nice cuppa juice, tea or hot drink could be a good idea.</p>
            <p>I am a long life learner. settling into studing was hard at the beginning specially coiplrd with rasing a family. I use to be terrified 
                and even so now when I hear of assignments, test and oooh, did i mention exam(s)? Years of practice thankfully, meant i could kind of say 
                negotaiating the skills (see how i can not say master) is getting better. 
                Everyday is different for me but, i try to read alittle here and there code (a lot) and getting better at it. Every little practice goes a long way.
            </p>
            <p> Being a supportive mother meant that working full time was almost impossible to attain for me, no matter how hard i tried. 
                Some people say i am a pushy mother but i disagree and explain we get up and get things done. it is exhilatring when we 
                do well and when we fail, we get dust ourseves up and start agin. it could be exhausting but ikeep trying.
                (there were times that I feel so exustaed but had to pretend i was reading and doing somethings so taht even when i only 
                achieve learning a word, that is rewarding for me.)that is simply because i feel if i dont i may loose my swag. i never 
                want to loss quest fro learning.

           <p>I will cut the  chase here now!
           </p>
            
            <p> I studies various courses both vocational and academia. Curious about coding, I enrolled onto an Adult evening 
                and did Dreamweaver  at Burnley College that was a few years ago.  
            </p>
            <p>The spark was  ingited specially after having experience of checking out a Tesla at a show and shopping center,
                and bearing in mind my duaghter been an Engineering enthusiated from childhood and (studying engineering now) 
                 had for a while been idolises Elon Musk as her hero (which was recommended by her science tutor) it was easy to do 
                 i must be made to get tired of researching waht Tesla is doing.
                 As a way of motivation and dreaming of may be having tesla one day, i feel the coding will come handy. 
                curiosity.
